# Instagram-Clone-SQL-Data-Analysis-Project

### Objective : 

The objective of this project is to leverage a cloned Instagram database to conduct a comprehensive SQL-based analysis, extracting actionable insights regarding user behaviour, content trends, and platform engagement. This analysis will aim to identify key patterns and relationships within the data, providing a deeper understanding of users' behaviour on the Instagram platform.

### Key Functions and techniques used:

o	Database and Table Creation: SQL database structured to store Instagram data, including tables for users, posts, likes, and comments.

o	SQL Syntax and Aggregate Functions: Data retrieval and summarisation using standard SQL syntax and aggregate functions (COUNT(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN()).

o	DateTime Functions: Extraction of date and time components for analysing user activity trends over time.

o	SQL Joins: Combining data from multiple tables (users, posts, likes, comments) using different join types.

### Key Insights:

o	Peak Registration Days: Sunday and Thursday.

o	Oldest Users: Darby Herzog, Emilio Bernier52, Elenor88, Nicole 71, and Jordyn. Jacobson2.

o	Most Liked Posts: Zack_Kemmer93 and Malinda_Streich.

o	Average Posts Per User: Approximately 2.57.

### Application of Insights:

o	Marketing and Campaign Planning: Optimise ad scheduling based on peak registration days; re-engage inactive users with targeted campaigns; boost engagement with regular contests.

o	User Retention and Loyalty: Reward long-term users with exclusive programs; feature top content creators to encourage continued posting.

o	Product and Platform Health: Detect bot activity through engagement patterns; clean up bot-driven engagement to maintain metric accuracy.

o	Engagement and Content Strategy: Leverage top hashtags to guide content creation; tailor content formats to different user segments based on posting activity.
